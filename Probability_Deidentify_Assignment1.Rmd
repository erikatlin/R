#### Section 1: Probability : Total points 50


Q1. Which of the following numbers cannot be probability? Explain why.     

a) -0.0001
b) 0.05
c) 3.415
d) 20%
e) 1

Ans 1. The probability must lie between 0 and 1. 0 indicates impossible, while 1 indicates certain. Probability can also be represented by percentage, decimal, or fraction. 
A) There cannot be a negative probability indicating it is impossible for an event to occur. 
C) This is greater than 1 and cannot occur.  

Q2. A card is drawn randomly from a deck of ordinary playing cards. The game rules are that you win if the card is a spade or an ace. What is the probability that you will win the game?

Ans 2. P(S) = 13/52; P(A) = 4/52; P(S and A) = 1/52
P(S or A) = P(S) + P(A) - P(S and A) 
          = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52
          = 16/52 = 4/13
 
Q3. An urban hospital has a 20% mortality rate on average for admitted patients. If on a particular day, 17 patients got admitted, what are:

a) the chances that exactly 7 will survive? n = 17, k = 7 
factorial(17)/((factorial(7) * factorial(10)) x (0.8)^7 x (0.2)^10 = 0.042%


b) the chances that at least 15 patients will survive? P(X>=15) = P(X=15, 16, 17)  
(17,15): factorial(17)/((factorial(15) * factorial(2)) x (0.8)^15 x (0.2)^2 = 0.19
(17,16): factorial(17)/((factorial(16) * factorial(1)) x (0.8)^16 x (0.2)^1 = 0.096
(17,17): factorial(17)/((factorial(17) * factorial(0)) X (0.8)^17 x (0.2)^0 = 0.0225

P(15) + P (16) + P(17) = 0.31 = 31%

Ans 3. a) 0.042% ; b) 31%

Q4. Let F and G be two events such that P(F) is 0.4, P(G) is 0.8. F and G are independent events. Fill in the remaining elements of the table. 

Table    | $G$ | $\bar{G}$ | Marginal
---------|-----|-----------|----------
$F$      | 0.32|    0.08   |    0.4
$\bar{F}$| 0.48|    0.12   |    0.6
Marginal |  0.8|      0.2  |    1


Q5. Let F and G be two events such that P(F) is 0.2, P(G) is 0.7. Now, the conditional probability P(G|F) is given as 0.4. Fill in the remaining elements of the table. #conditional versus independent

Table    | $G$ | $\bar{G}$ | Marginal
---------|-----|-----------|----------
$F$      | 0.08|   0.12    |    0.2
$\bar{F}$| 0.62|   0.18    |    0.8
Marginal |  0.7|    0.3    |    1


Q6. A survey was conducted among 100 patients about smoking status. The following is the sample size split by smoking status (Yes or No) and gender (Male or Female). 


Table    | Smoking (Yes) | Smoking(No) | Total
---------|---------------|-------------|----------
Male     |      19       |       36    | 55
Female   |      13       |       32    | 45
Total    |      32       |       68    | 100 


The probability that a randomly selected patient is a male who smokes is 0.19.  

(a) Fill in all the elements of the table


(b) What is the probability of a randomly selected patient being a female? P(F) = 45/100 = 0.45   
 

(c) What is the probability of a randomly selected patient being a smoker? P(S) = 32/100 = 0.32    


(d)  What is the probability of a randomly selected smoker being a female? P(S and F) = 13/32 = 0.406 ~ 0.41   


#### Section 2: Data Analysis using R: Total points 25


Q1 : Using the dataset provided ("sample_patient_dataset.csv"), the task to build a 2x2 table for the studying the association between age at admission >70 and cardiac arrests. You can either use the sample table given below or build your own. Rememer to output both count and % in the table. Be sure to round the % to the nearest integer (e.g, 0.674 will be 67% and 0.675 will be 68%, see notes in Lecture2 on summary statistics as example). Fill in the code in the shaded areas.


Table         | Cardiac Arrests (Yes) | Cardiac Arrests (No) | Total
--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------
Age > 70 (%)  |       453 (2%)        |     4728 (20%)       |  5181 (21%)
Age <= 70 (%) |      1672 (7%)        |    17,254 (72%)      | 18,926 (79%)
Total         |     2125  (9%)        |    21982  (91%)      | 24,107
